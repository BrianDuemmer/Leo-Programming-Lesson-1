		/* Quick Lesson: Modulus
		   When you use the division operator, the program returns an integer (rounding) or decimal.
		   The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of division.
		   Ex. 10/5 = 2 BUT 10%5 = 0. Why?
		       9/2 = 4.5 BUT 9%2 = 1
		       0/n = 0 AND 0%n = 0
		       1/5 = 0.2 BUT 1%5 = 1 *Think: lower number % higher number = lower
		   Can be used to display odd/even numbers:
		   Odd: if(n%2 == 1)
		   Even: if(n%2 == 0)

		   What is a loop? What does it do?
		   
		   For Loops
		  
		   for(Initialization; Condition; Control)
		   { 
		  	 Statement(s);
		   }
		   
		   Initialization: Starting Point.
		   for(int x=# ...)
		   OR		
		   int x;
		   for(x=# ...)
		   
		   Condition: Remember the conditional statements we reviewed last time (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=).
		   for(x=0;x<# ...)
		   
		   Control: Increment/Decrement.
		   x++ = x+1 and x-- = x-1
		   You can use other operators too such as * and /.
		   for(x=0;x<10;x+2)
		   
		   Ex. for(int x=0;x<9;x++) How many times does it run?
		   
		   Ex. for(int x=1;x<=10;x++) How many times does it run?
		   
		   Ex. for(int x=10;x>0;x--)
		       {
		   		   System.out.print(x);
		       }                            What is the output?
		   
		   NOW ITS TIME TO WRITE YOUR OWN! MAKE A FOR LOOP THAT DISPLAYS ONLY ODD NUMBERS (Hint: use if/else and modulus).
		   
		   
		   
		   
		   While Loops
		   
		   while(condition)
		   {
		       Statement(s);
		       MUST INCLUDE CONTROL TO STOP!
		   }
		   For loops are basically condensed while loops.
